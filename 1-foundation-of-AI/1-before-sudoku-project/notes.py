# Navigation is an AI problem, which can be better modified by AI
# Heuristic: Some additional piece of information - a rule, a function or constraint that informs an otherwise brute-force algorithm to act in a more optimal manner.
#  启发式算法: 当传统方法速度较慢时，用牺牲准确性，完整性，优化性的方法来实现速度上的提升。
# e.g. Monty Hall Problem (3扇门，其中一个后面有车，另外两个后面有羊)
#   其中，Probability就是一个 Heuristic Function

# Agent: Intelligent system (software)
# Environment: Hardware of agent, all other external object
# State: The behavior of an agent
# Goal State: The objective state
# Perception: Help an agent receive information from environment
# Action: The process of changing a state
# Cognition: The process of an agent decides what action to take based on perception

# Type of AI problems:
#   Fully observable: Ai knows everything
#   Partially observable: Ai only know part of the game
#   Deterministic: Action is predictable
#   Stochastic: Action is random
#   Discrete: Action is limited
#   Continous: Action is unlimited
#   Benign: Ai is the only player
#   Adversarial: Ai has opponents

# What is Intelligence
#   Rational Behavior: An intelligent agent is one that takes action to maximize its expected utility given a desired goal.
#   Bounded Optimality: A way to quantify intelligence. 不是绝对的最优，而是条件下的最优解。
